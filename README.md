Creating a LessCss compiler for Java based on V8

For now it only works with win (I have to manage a way to load the V8 library en linux/windows/mac detecting the operating system).
I need also to pass the different options that less provides (beautify, etc), but It's a good start :)

It used the 2.5.1 version of Less.
